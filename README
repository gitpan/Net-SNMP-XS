NAME
    Net::SNMP::XS - speed up Net::SNMP by decoding in XS, with limitations

SYNOPSIS
     use Net::SNMP::XS;

     # loading it is enough, there are no public symbols

DESCRIPTION
    This module tries to speed up Net::SNMP response packet decoding.

    It does this by overriding a few selected internal method by (almost)
    equivalent XS methods.

    This currently reduces decode time by a factor of ten for typical bulk
    responses.

    There are currently the following limitations when using this module:

    overriding internal functions might cause the module to malfunction with
    future versions of Net::SNMP
    error messages will be simpler/different
    translation will be ignored (all values will be delivered "raw")
    a moderately modern (>= C99) C compiler is required
    only tested with 5.10, no intentions to port to older perls
    duplicate OIDs are not supported
    REPORT PDUs are not supported
